# Agentic Wellness Coaching System

## Problem Statement
Agentic Systems for Healthcare and Fitness — multi-domain wellness coaching (fitness, nutrition, mental health, preventive). Wellness-only; no medical diagnosis or treatment.

## Why an Agentic System?
- Goal-oriented: explicit long-term goals per domain
- Planning: multi-step plans, not single responses
- Autonomy: independent decisions on adaptations
- Observation: tracks adherence and difficulty
- Adaptation: plan changes based on feedback
- Reasoning transparency: logs every step

## Domains Covered
- Fitness & habit formation
- Nutrition planning & dietary guidance
- Mental health & stress management (non-clinical)
- Preventive wellness monitoring (non-diagnostic)

## Agent Roles
- PlannerAgent: identify goals, create/adapt plans per domain
- DecisionAgent: decide when/how to adapt, choose interventions, goal escalation
- FeedbackAgent: observe completion, infer difficulty, aggregate feedback

## Agent Loop
Plan → Act → Observe → Adapt (logged every iteration)
